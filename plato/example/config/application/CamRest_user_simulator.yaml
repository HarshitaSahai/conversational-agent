GENERAL:
  # Can be: simulation, text, speech, or multi-agent
  interaction_mode: simulation

  # How many conversational agents to spawn
  agents: 1

  # Define whether the agents will be generic or not
  generic: False

  # How many times to run this experiment. Each experiment will run the
  # number of dialogues specified in the DIALOGUE section. This is useful
  # for example when evaluating stochastic dialogue policies, where we want
  # to calculate the average performance over several runs.
  runs: 1

  # Handle Plato internal experience logs. These are logs produced by the
  # dialogue Episode Recorder (under utilities) and contain information about
  # what has happened during the dialogue(s). Plato agents use these logs as
  # data for training.

  # These are global arguments (only used in Generic Agent mode) and are added
  # to the arguments of each module of each agent. In this simple example we
  # provide the ontology, database, and domain that every module needs.

DIALOGUE:
  # How many dialogues to run for
  num_dialogues: 10

  # Which role has the initiative (speaks first): system or user
  initiative: system

  # The current domain, e.g. CamRest, SlotFilling
  domain: CamRest

  # The path to the ontology .json file (not needed if provided in global args)

  # The database type (not needed if provided in global args)

  # We can provide a path to saved goals instead of randomly sampling at
  # the beginning of each dialogue. The goals file should be a .pkl file.

# For each agent i specified in the GENERAL section we need to have an
# AGENT_<i> section, containing the configuration for that particular agent.
